## Research

My research focuses on applying remote sensing and spatial analysis to understand vegetation dynamics, species distribution, and ecological change.

## Flower Color Index (FCI)
This project investigates spatial and temporal patterns of flower color using the **Flower Color Index (FCI)** derived from satellite imagery. The approach enables large-scale monitoring of flowering phenology and vegetation characteristics.

## High-Resolution Species Mapping with PlanetScope Imagery
This project uses **PlanetScope high-resolution imagery** to map species distributions and habitat characteristics. The fine spatial resolution allows for detailed species-level classification and landscape pattern analysis.


**Key aspects:**
- High-resolution multispectral imagery  
- Species-level classification  
- Machine learning approaches  

**Publication:**  
Thapa, B., *et al.* (Year). *Title of the paper*. **Journal Name**.

## Regional-Scale Species Mapping Using Multi-temporal Landsat Images

This project explores **Landsat time-series data** for regional-scale species mapping and long-term ecological monitoring. The work emphasizes temporal consistency and historical change analysis.


**Key aspects:**
- Long-term satellite archives  
- Time-series analysis  
- Scalable regional mapping  

**Publication:**  
Thapa, B., *et al.* (Year). *Title of the paper*. **Journal Name**.
