## Bina Thapa

I am a **postdoctoral researcher at Purdue University** specializing in the remote sensing of forested ecosystems. My research utilizes **multispectral, hyperspectral, and LiDAR data** to investigate forest ecosystem patterns and processes, including species identification, phenology monitoring, and disturbance assessment. I aim to advance our understanding of forest ecosystem dynamics and to develop methods that enhance forest monitoring and characterization.

### Research Focus
- Species identification  
- Phenology monitoring  
- Disturbance assessment  

### Methodologies
- Multispectral imagery  
- Hyperspectral data  
- LiDAR analysis  
- Algorithm development
