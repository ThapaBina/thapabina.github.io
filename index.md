## Bina Thapa

I am a **postdoctoral researcher at Purdue University** specializing in the remote sensing of forested ecosystems. My research utilizes **multispectral, hyperspectral, and LiDAR data** to investigate forest ecosystem patterns and processes, including species identification, phenology monitoring, and disturbance assessment.

I aim to advance our understanding of forest ecosystem dynamics and develop methods that enhance forest monitoring and characterization.

### Current Position
I am working under the supervision of  
- [Dr. Songlin Fei](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~sfei/feiS.php)  
- [Dr. Brady S. Hardiman](https://www.purdue.edu/fnr/sites/hardiman/)

### Research Focus
- Species identification  
- Phenology monitoring  
- Disturbance assessment  

### Methodologies
- Multispectral imagery  
- Hyperspectral data  
- LiDAR analysis  
- Algorithm development
